I'm a dedicated computer science student working toward both my bachelor's and master's degrees simultaneously, and I’ve also completed a Data Science Bootcamp through Rutgers University. What really sets me apart is how genuinely interested I am in the subject—every class gets me curious, and I always end up diving deeper on my own, studying beyond what's required. I'm excited to bring that same energy and drive into a hands-on internship experience.
